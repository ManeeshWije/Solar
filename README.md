-   This project was built using Three.js, React.js, Javascript, HTML, and CSS
-   The purpose of it was to familiarize myself with 3D objects, animations, texture mapping, and camera views/controls
-   The application roughly simulates our solar system with relative values that can be scaled and also displays important information about each planet
-   This project can be expanded in the future for more celestial bodies as well as new information
-   API for planet info: https://api.le-systeme-solaire.net/en/
